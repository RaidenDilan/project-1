<center><h2>Game Instructions</h2></center>

* Instructions are straight forward. Up, Down, Left, Right on a desktop.
* And on iPhone and iPad it's swiping instead of a visual button.

<center><h2>How it works</h2></center>

* It's simple you choose a difficulty you then click the start button and you try to get to the finish point. Beware that there are walls so if you run into them you will strat again from the beginning of maze.
* If you finish the maze before the timer runs out, your remaining time will be added to your score.

<center><h2>Project Workflow</h2></center>

* I started out with pseudocoding my game.
* I used wireframing
* I used git hub and commited several times during each day.

<center><h2>Technical Requirements</h2></center>

* I met all of the requirements of the project.
* I Used all the tools that I learned in class and used documentations and used stackoverflow.
* I built a reasonably complex game and it looks easy to play but there are different difficulty levels.

<center><h2>Creativity</h2></center>

* So I used a Gif for my character to give a personal touch to my game.
* Used animations to make the game look more fun and added a background audio.
* Animation was created using the Animate.css stylesheet.
