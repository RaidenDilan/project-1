#Approach

I wanted to create a maze game because as a child I was almost obsessed with them, so I set out to build one myself and put a few things in there are you would not normally find in a maze game.

<h1>Rules of the Game:</h1>

Begin by clicking Selecting a difficulty and clicking play, this will generate a grid depending on the difficulty chosen. To start the game the user must click on Start button under the maze grid.

Rules are;

* Depending on the difficulty a play chooses, you'll have a set time to get out of the maze. 
* There are hidden walls, if you hit any it will appear in red for very short time and out you at the start of the maze.
* There directions are Up, Right, Down, Left, not very complicated.
* There is a choice to restart the maze game if unsatisfied with your first approach.
* There is also a pause audio button if the music is distracting.
* When a level is completed, the countdown will stop and will be added to your points.

<h1>Technologies Used</h1>

* HTML5, CSS, jQuery were used to create the game.
* The Google Web Font 'Pirulen' has been used to style the game.
* Animation was created using the Animate.css stylesheet.
* GarageBand was used to edit the audios used in this game.

<h1>Challenges & Problems</h1>

The main challenges I had whilst building the game was knowing how the game worked and how I can put that into code. I had a week to do as my first project and I wasn't sure how much time I needed to build a full functioning game. I struggled when creating a function to place intelligent moves. I would have liked to take this further with more time, to ultimately make the game more complex and give each difficulty different variety of things happening. Another thing I would have liked to add was displaying the game instructions before the user plays the chosen grid. I would have also like to give the score board system a more complex feel to it have a board displaying all the users score records. Last but not least I waned to add tap and swipe functionality to the game so users can play the game on their smart devices, but sadly there was not enough time and the challenge itself was very difficult for me to achieve on my 2-3 week of learning how to code. 

I also had different ideas for themes for the game, so the player could choose what theme they wanted to play. For example: 'zombies, rainy day, etc'.

<h4>Features & Bugs</h4>

Currnetly there is no sound playing in the background, it's something to do with hosting it on Heroku.
